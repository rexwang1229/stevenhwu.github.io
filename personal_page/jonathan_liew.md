Hey pal! Looking for someone?

Well, maybe this helps:
Jonathan is a Malaysian undergraduate currently studying Agronomy at National Taiwan University. These days, he’s wandering around Steven’s lab, exploring the mysterious world of bioinformatics.

At the moment, he’s still torn between diving deeper into plant genetics or venturing further into computational biology (a.k.a. the land of Python, pipelines, and panic). Got any advice for this lost little soul?
