## Shawn Chen

<img src="{{site.url}}/img/shawn_chen.jpg" align="left" hspace="10" width="25%">

Shawn is a second-year master's student. He always sits in front of the computer, seeming like the chair and keyboard have trapped him. If you see him stuck in some trouble, don’t worry; he’s doing it voluntarily.

#### Research project

I am currently engaged in an eDNA metabarcoding project that involves analyzing sequences collected from environmental samples using bioinformatic tools and simulating the eDNA sampling process to assess the performance of the proposed clustering-based species delimitation approach.
