Well, since someone actually clicked in, I'll tell you more. You can call me Tim. I'm a junior in college. Besides being a bit decent at badminton, I'm pretty much a homebody. In my free time, I hang out with friends and play League of Legends (recently, it's been Lethal Company), although lately, I don't have much free time.
